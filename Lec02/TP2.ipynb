Jack starts at the bottom-left corner, and his goal is to navigate the grid to collect treasures. There are two types of treasures: a small one at (2, 2) that rewards him with 1 gold each time he collects it, and a large one at (4, 4) that rewards him with 10 gold each time. Walls are present at (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 3), and Jack cannot pass through these cells (they are not considered as state therefore).\n","\n","Beware of cliffs at (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3), as falling off a cliff will cost Jack 100 gold. Additionally, some cells are slippery (the blue ones shown in the figure below), increasing the likelihood of falling into a cliff.\n","\n","Since Jack has consumed some rum, he has an 80% chance of performing the intended action and a 20% chance of performing a random action. He can move right, left, up, or down.
